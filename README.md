<p class="has-normal-font-size">This is where the Windows Startmenu Creator Tool comes to play. The tool will help us export the XML from a reference device and will ease the taskbar customization process by a lot... it will even connect to MEM, upload the XML and create the policy for you, how awesome is that?! üòç</p>
